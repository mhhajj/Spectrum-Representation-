<h2 id="2">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this lab, we explore the synthesis and analysis of beat notes and chirps signals commonly used in communication and signal processing. The goal is to create amplitude-modulated (AM) and frequency-modulated (FM) signals and study their frequency characteristics using spectrograms, which show how frequency content changes over time. First, we generate beat notes by summing two sinusoidal signals with slightly different frequencies, creating a pattern of amplitude fluctuations. This exercise helps us understand the relationship between time and frequency domains. Then, we use spectrograms to analyze the frequency content of signals, examining the trade-off between time and frequency resolution by varying window lengths. Finally, we study the spectrogram of a chirp signal to observe its continuous frequency sweep over time. This lab provides practical experience in signal synthesis and time-frequency analysis.</p>
<h2 id="3">4.1 Beat Notes</h2>
<p>(a). In the section on beat notes, we analyze the situation in which we have two sinusoidal signals of slightly different frequencies; i.e. x(t) = A cos[2π(f_c - f_Δ)t] + B cos[2π(f_c + f_Δ)t]</p>

<p>Beat notes provide an interesting way to investigate the time-frequency characteristics of spectrograms. This section explores the fundamental trade-off between identifying frequencies in a signal and tracking their changes over time. [We'll investigate how spectrogram window length affects our ability to resolve frequency components and track frequency changes, drawing parallels to Heisenberg']s Uncertainty Principle. x(t) = Acos(2π(f_c-f_δ)t) + Acos(2π(f_c+f_δ)t) = A[cos(2πf_δt)]cos(2πf_ct) This equation allows us to view beat note signals in two ways: as a combination of two constant-frequency signals, or as a single-frequency signal with time-varying amplitude. Both perspectives will guide our analysis of how window length impacts beat signal spectrograms.</p>

With a window length 2048 points, the resolution is high in frequency but low in time, averaging the signal over an extended period and obscuring fine temporal variations. While the correct frequencies are present, capturing the primary frequency content at 2000Hz, this window length smooths out other details.</p>

<img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="beat_04.png" alt=""> <p>(c). Spectrogram using a window length of 16 The spectrogram analysis shows the impact of window length on time-frequency resolution. With a window length 16, the spectrogram displays numerous horizontal stripes, indicating multiple frequency components. The carrier frequency (2000 Hz) remains visible, though spectral leakage introduces artifacts.</p>
<p>Compared to the window length 2048 used in Part (b), which offered excellent frequency resolution but poor temporal detail, the window in Part (c) captures rapid signal changes at the expense of frequency accuracy. This trade-off illustrates the inverse relationship between temporal and frequency resolution in spectrogram analysis, where improving one aspect necessarily compromises the other.</p>

% This equation allows us to view beat note signals in two ways: as a combination of two constant-frequency signals, 
% or as a single-frequency signal with time-varying amplitude. Both perspectives will guide our analysis of how 
% window length impacts beat signal spectrograms.

% (a). Create and plot a beat signal with new inputs
% Assume A = B = 10
fa = 32;   % Hz
Tdur = 0.26;   % duration in seconds
fs = 11025;   % sampling frequency in Hz
fe = 2000;   % center frequency in Hz

% Generate time vector and signal
tt = 0:1/fs:Tdur;
x = cos(2 * pi * (fe - fa) * tt) + cos(2 * pi * (fe + fa) * tt);

% (b). Spectrogram using a window length of 2048
% The spectrogram shows a single dominant frequency component centered around fc=2000Hz. 
% With a window length 2048 points, the resolution is high in frequency but low in time, 
% averaging the signal over an extended period and obscuring fine temporal variations. 
% While the correct frequencies are present, capturing the primary frequency content at 2000Hz, 
% this window length smooths out other details.

%%
% (c). Spectrogram using a window length of 16
% The spectrogram analysis shows the impact of window length on time-frequency resolution. 
% With a window length 16, the spectrogram displays numerous horizontal stripes, 
% indicating multiple frequency components. The carrier frequency (2000 Hz) remains visible, 
% though spectral leakage introduces artifacts. 
%
% Compared to the window length 2048 used in Part (b), which offered excellent frequency resolution but poor temporal detail, 
% the window in Part (c) captures rapid signal changes at the expense of frequency accuracy. 
% This trade-off illustrates the inverse relationship between temporal and frequency resolution in spectrogram analysis, 
% where improving one aspect necessarily compromises the other.

%% 4.3 Spectrogram of a Chirp
% The chirp signal has a duration of 3 seconds and uses a sampling frequency of fs = 11025 Hz. 
% Its frequency decreases linearly from 5000 Hz to 300 Hz. When played, you can hear this downward frequency sweep clearly.

function [xx, tt] = mychirp(f1, f2, dur, fsamp)
    % MYCHIRP Generate a linear-FM chirp signal
    %
    % Usage:
    % [xx, tt] = mychirp(f1, f2, dur, fsamp)
    %
    % f1 = starting frequency
    % f2 = ending frequency
    % dur = total time duration
    % fsamp = sampling frequency (optional, default = 11025 Hz)
    % xx = samples of the chirp signal
    % tt = vector of time instants for t = 0 to t = dur
    
    % Default sampling frequency
    if nargin < 4
        fsamp = 11025; % Default sampling rate
    end
    
    dt = 1 / fsamp; % Time step
    tt = 0 : dt : dur; % Time vector
    
    % Linear chirp formula
    psi = 2 * pi * (f1 * tt + ((f2 - f1) / (2 * dur)) * tt.^2);
    xx = real(exp(1j * psi)); % Chirp signal (real part)
end

% When changing the frequency, using positive and negative values [won't make the sound 
% alternate between rising and falling. Looking at the graph, we can see that negative 
% frequencies are converted to positive ones, resulting in an upward sound. 
% This occurs because frequencies cannot be negative, and the cosine of a negative number 
% equals the cosine of its positive counterpart. As a result, the graph reflects across the horizontal axis.

f_start1 = 5000;     % Start frequency in Hz
